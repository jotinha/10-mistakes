# Disclaimer

These are *my* mistakes and they don't represent the typical DS at Farfetch. These are things I did, and sometimes still do, despite the best efforts of my managers, team and the organization to teach me otherwise. That I can make this presentation today is a testament that they have been at least partially succesful in helping me improve.
