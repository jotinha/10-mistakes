# Disclaimer

These are *my* mistakes and they don't represent the typical DS at Farfetch. These are things I did, and sometimes still do, despite the best efforts of my managers, team and the organization to teach me otherwise. That I can make this presentation today is a testament that they have been at least partially succesful in helping me improve.

## I think of the title of my presentations before the content

* A corollary: We think of the acronym for our tools/services before we figure out the meaning of the letters
	* PRECOG: **P**ython **Reco**mmendations **g**enerator
	* COMPAL: **Comp**lementary **A**ctive **L**earning
	* DATMAN: **Dat**a **mon**itoring
	* VIPER: **V**isual ...

* This is not actually a mistake, this is the best part of the job
